# CSVanalysis

A data visualization tool that converts text columns from a CSV file into embeddings within a vector space using a transformer language model. It can clusters similar vectors (CSV rows) together and plot them, grouping together semantically similar rows.

## Showcase

Deploying the backend was a challenge due to the high memory usage of the embedding model, so I made a quick showcase of how it works instead.
